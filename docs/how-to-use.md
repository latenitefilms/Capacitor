# How To Use

When you first run **Capacitor** you'll be presented with a window like this:

As the window explains, simply drag a FCPXML file from Finder to the drop zone, or click the window to select a file.

When the FCPXML is loaded you'll be presented with something like this:

You can then select the FCPXML version you want to convert to from the Destination dropdown:

In this case I'm converting a `v1.9` FCPXML into a `v1.6` FCPXML that works with Final Cut Pro `v10.3`:

You can see the list of warnings of the things in the FCPXML that are not supported.

You can click the **Warnings** button to export a text file of the warnings.

You can click **Back** button at the top to abort the conversion.

If available, you can click the **FCPXML Bundle** button to export a FCPXML Bundle. This is only available in FCPXML v1.10 and above.

You can click the **FCPXML** button to export a regular FCPXML file.

If you click **Export** you'll be asked where to save the new FCPXML:

After clicking **Export** the file will be converted:

Once it's done, you'll be presented with:

![](/static/how-to-use-07.png)

You can click the **OK** button to go back to the previous window, or **Reveal in Finder** to open the Finder window of the saved item.

It's that simple! Capacitor will always export a valid FCPXML file.
