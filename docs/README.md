# Capacitor

**Capacitor** allows you to easily convert between FCPXML versions.

> [:icon-desktop-download: **Click here to buy on the Mac App Store**](/buy/)

For example, if you're working on **Final Cut Pro 10.8**, but you have an online artist on an older Autodesk Flame, you can convert from FCPXML `v1.12` to `v1.9`.

Or if you have an old FCPXML in your archives, you can upgrade from `v1.8` to `v1.10`.

If there are differences between FCPXML versions, Capacitor will offer a list of warnings that you can also export.

Because Capacitor ensures it outputs FCPXML following Apple's strict DTD rules, you can also use Capacitor to "clean" FCPXMLs - for example, it corrects [this bug](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/314) in Final Cut Pro's output.

It support both `.fcpxml` files and FCPXML Bundles (`.fcpxmld`).
