# Capacitor

**Capacitor** allows you to easily convert between FCPXML versions.

![](/static/homepage.png)

!!!
Capacitor is currently in **early development**.<br />
We are currently beta testing via Apple's TestFlight.<br />
You can learn more [here](/how-to-use/).
!!!

For example, if you're working on **Final Cut Pro 10.7**, but you have an online artist on an older Autodesk Flame, you can convert from FCPXML `v1.11` to `v1.9`.

Or if you have an old FCPXML in your archives, you can upgrade from `v1.8` to `v1.10`.

Because Capacitor ensures it outputs FCPXML following Apple's strict DTD rules, you can also use Capacitor to "clean" FCPXMLs.
